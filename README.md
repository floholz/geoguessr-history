On the activities page you can now find a checkbox in the top-right, under your profile icon. With this checkbox you can toggle off the new game history.
The `Game History` shows a table of the recent games, parsed from your activities. The table right away shows you a couple of key stats from this game. By clicking the game you, will be navigated to the game's page.
